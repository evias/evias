* add auto release pool feature
    - should be based on std::auto_ptr, though acting
      as a Mac OS X reference counter which would
      extend the reusability of pointers and free
      the developer of memory problems.

--- 0.8 ---
--------------

* add typed container logic classes.
* add container classes working with non-iteration data
  access.
* implement files data access
    - documents: xls*, doc*, ppt, pdf, odt
    - images: svg, png, jpg, gif
* implement files data export

--- 0.7.9 ----

* implement enhanced regular expressions parsing features
    - should allow any regular expression to be parsed
    - work with easy to use data accessors

--- 0.7.8 ----

* implement regular expression parsing feature
    - first version should allow basic parse of patterns
      returning a map<int,string> where the int represents
      the position and string the pattern matching value.
    - bool matchesPattern(string value, string pattern)

--- 0.7.7 ----

* unitary test suite entries may sometimes
  depend on the result of co-descendants.
  defining a relation between tests should
  thus be possible.
* unitary test'ify the whole library features.

--- 0.7.6 ----

* add unitary tests for network module.
* add unitary test suite logic class.
    - adapt all unitary tests to be executed
      using a suite.

--- 0.7.5 ----

* add container logic classes working with data pointers.
    - should be working with 8-bits data representation
      as this would be a very good base of the network
      packet logic classes.
* add network module
    - packet logic : see TCP and UDP specifications.
    - add network connection logic, working with
      sockets.
      . add TCP/IP connection class

--- 0.7.2 ----

* add threading logic classes.
    - add Lock class, process Lock logic.
    - add Mutex class for managing the threads locking.
* add macro definitions, test compilation on windows
  and change classes if needed.
* add object utilities
    - notClonable : easy to use interface
      for unclonable objects.
    - updateableObject : easy to use interface
      for object logic.

--- 0.7 ----
------------

* add SQL classes
    - adapter abstraction
    - pgsql adapter
    - dbTable logic
        - should work with a template class name based on
          a dbAdapter. As by example MySQL won't get the
          fields of a table from information_schema relation
          as would PgSQL.
* add SQL queries writing classes
    - should allow a simple write of queries
    - queries execution is not considered for
      these classes.
* add unitary tests

------------
--- 0.6 ----
------------

* add JSON reading and writing classes
    - should allow single entries, array entries and
      object entries.
* add .ini files reading and writing classes
* add unitary tests

------------
--- 0.5 ----
------------

* import old classes, implemented in 2002, the library
  had been forgotten on an old PC. ^^
